    Discovery and Access Matrix" (ADA-M). The Automatable Discovery and Access Matrix
    (ADA-M) provides a standardized way to unambiguously represent the conditions
    related to data discovery and access. By adopting ADA-M, data custodians can generally
    describe what their data are (the Header section), who can access them (the Permissions
    section), terms related to their use (the Terms section), and special conditions
    (the Meta-Conditions). By doing so, data custodians can participate in data sharing
    and collaboration by making meta information about their data computer-readable
    and hence directly available for digital communication, searching and automation
    activities.

    citable and through OpenAIRE integrates them into existing reporting lines to
    funding agencies like the European Commission. Citation information is also passed
    to DataCite and onto the scholarly aggregators. Content is available publicly
    under any one of 400 open licences (from opendefinition.org and spdx.org). Restricted
    and Closed content is also supported. Free for researchers below 50 GB/dataset.
    Content is both online on disk and offline on tape as part of a long-term preservation
    policy. Zenodo supports managed access (with an access request workflow) as well
    as embargoing generally and during peer review. The base infrastructure of Zenodo
    is provided by CERN, a non-profit IGO. Projects are funded through grants.

    use standards, databases, repositories and policy with confidence, and producers
    to make their resources more discoverable, more widely adopted and cited. Each
    record in FAIRsharing is curated in collaboration with the maintainers of the
    resource themselves, ensuring that the metadata in the FAIRsharing registry is
    accurate and timely. Every record is manually reviewed at least once a year. Records
    can be collated into collections, based on a project, society or organisation,
    or Recommendations, where they are collated around a policy, such as a journal
    or funder data policy.

- description: The 1+ Million Genomes (1+MG) initiative aims to enable secure access to genomics and the corresponding clinical data across Europe for better research, personalised healthcare and health policy making. Since the Digital Day 2018, 25 EU countries, the UK and Norway signed Member States declaration on stepping up efforts towards creating a European data infrastructure for genomic data and implementing common national rules enabling federated data access. The initiative forms part of the EU's agenda for the Digital Transformation of Health and Care and is aligned with the goals of the European Health Data Space.

- description: Responsible sharing of biomedical data and biospecimens via the "Automatable Discovery and Access Matrix" (ADA-M). The Automatable Discovery and Access Matrix (ADA-M) provides a standardized way to unambiguously represent the conditions related to data discovery and access. By adopting ADA-M, data custodians can generally describe what their data are (the Header section), who can access them (the Permissions section), terms related to their use (the Terms section), and special conditions (the Meta-Conditions). By doing so, data custodians can participate in data sharing and collaboration by making meta information about their data computer-readable and hence directly available for digital communication, searching and automation activities.

Data submitted to any of the three organizations are shared among them. SRA accepts data from all kinds of sequencing projects including clinically important studies that involve human subjects or their metagenomes, which may contain human sequences. These data often have a controlled access via dbGaP (the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes).

- description: Zenodo is a generalist research data repository built and developed by OpenAIRE and CERN. It was developed to aid Open Science and is built on open source code. Zenodo helps researchers receive credit by making the research results citable and through OpenAIRE integrates them into existing reporting lines to funding agencies like the European Commission. Citation information is also passed to DataCite and onto the scholarly aggregators. Content is available publicly under any one of 400 open licences (from opendefinition.org and spdx.org). Restricted and Closed content is also supported. Free for researchers below 50 GB/dataset. Content is both online on disk and offline on tape as part of a long-term preservation policy. Zenodo supports managed access (with an access request workflow) as well as embargoing generally and during peer review. The base infrastructure of Zenodo is provided by CERN, a non-profit IGO. Projects are funded through grants.

Provenance is information documenting the history of an object, such as a dataset or a sample. For a general description and approaches applicable to all domains, follow to the general provenance page. After getting familiar with the general description, you can proceed to domain-specific pages. Reading the general page before proceeding to the domain-specific pages is not necessary, but it is recommended.

## Attribution and Citation

In science, __proper attribution__ is a cornerstone of ethical research and collaboration. Recognising the contributions of others not only fosters transparency but also builds a robust foundation for trust and credibility in scientific work. Citing sources accurately is essential to ensure that the original creators receive the credit they deserve, and it strengthens the validity of new findings by linking them to prior knowledge and advancements.

Using __persistent identifiers__, like [ORCIDs](https://orcid.org/), helps uniquely identify contributors, ensuring their work is properly acknowledged across all forms of scholarly output, including publications, datasets, and code. This fosters collaboration, increases reproducibility, and ensures that all contributions, whether in data, code, or methodology, receive due recognition. 

__Proper citation__ not only credits the original creators but also strengthens the credibility of new findings by linking them to previous work. When citing, follow established guidelines such as using consistent citation styles by the institution or publisher. It is relevant to accurately reference all sources consulted, including datasets, used software and code. Ensure that citations are complete with persistent identifiers like DOIs to facilitate traceability and proper acknowledgement. Sticking to a single citation style is a good practice as it ensures consistency, enhances readability, and makes it easier for readers to locate and verify referenced sources.

## Licenses

When creating datasets, code, or other research outputs, it is vital to clearly and visibly label them with __appropriate licenses__. Licenses such as [Creative Commons CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/ ) provide transparency about the terms others may use, modify, or share the work. By doing so, researchers protect their rights and enable others to reuse their job responsibly.

For those __reusing scientific outputs__, carefully reviewing the associated licenses is crucial. Understanding the terms of reuse helps users comply with the legal and ethical standards set by the original creators. Proper attribution and adherence to licensing terms prevent misuse and uphold the principles of open science and shared knowledge.

An additional layer of diligence is necessary in sensitive research domains, such as health and infectious diseases. Data owners might use __restrictive licenses and access control mechanisms__. For example, health-related datasets containing personal or identifiable information may be shared under a Data Use Agreement (DUA)(e.g. [ECDC Tessy data sharing agreement](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/data-sharing-agreement-tessy-data)) or a controlled access model, such as the [European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA)](https://ega-archive.org/ ). These mechanisms restrict access to authorised researchers who meet ethical and legal requirements, ensuring data is used responsibly and aligned with privacy regulations like GDPR.

## Resources

To support responsible attribution and licensing practices, researchers and practitioners can access the following resources:
* [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/): A comprehensive guide to licensing options and their implications.
* [ChooseALicence]((https://choosealicense.com/): A dedicated page helping to choose an open-source licence  
* [ORCID](https://orcid.org/): A platform for creating and managing persistent identifiers for contributors .
* [RDMkit](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/): Best practices and guidelines for research data management, including topics such as  [licencing](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/licensing) and [sharing](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/sharing). 

By adhering to best practices in attribution, licensing, and the responsible reuse of data and code, researchers contribute to a culture of openness, integrity, and collaboration. These principles are vital in infectious disease research, where transparency and trust underpin impactful scientific advancements.

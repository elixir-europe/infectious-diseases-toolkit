Data description involves detailing the datasets used in research or surveillance. This includes, for example, finding and adhering to relevant standards for (meta)data and documentation to ensure that  data are accurately represented, interoperable, and reusable. Accurate data description improves the clarity and reliability of information regarding disease incidence, transmission, and treatment outcomes, which is essential for ensuring effective public health interventions and scientific studies. Good data description promotes data sharing among various stakeholders, allowing for more meta-analyses, and encouraging collaborations to improve the understanding and management of disease.

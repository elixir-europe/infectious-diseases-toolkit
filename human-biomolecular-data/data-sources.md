## Introduction

This document aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in the data sources platforms of infectious diseases using human biomolecular data, which have become increasingly important in recent years as a result of advancements in technology and the ever-growing threat of global pandemics. 

By providing this overview of the data sources platforms of infectious diseases using human biomolecular data, this document aims to facilitate the development of new research initiatives and collaborations in the field.


### What is human biomolecular data, and why is it important for infectious diseases research?

Human biomolecular data refers to information obtained from the analysis of biological molecules, such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites. This type of data is used to study the molecular mechanisms underlying disease and to identify potential drug targets.

Human clinical data, on the other hand, refers to information obtained from the study of patients, including their medical histories, physical exams, and laboratory tests. This type of data is used to diagnose and treat disease, as well as to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new therapies.

While both types of data are important for understanding human health and disease, they are collected and analysed in different ways and for different purposes. 

Human biomolecular data is of great importance in infectious disease research because it plays a critical role in understanding the molecular basis of the disease. By analyzing the biomolecular data, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the disease's pathogenesis, evolution, and transmission. Personalised medicine is another area where biomolecular data can be applied. By analyzing an individual's biomolecular data, researchers can develop personalised treatment plans that are tailored to the specific needs of the patient. For example, if a patient has a genetic mutation that predisposes them to a particular disease, this information can be used to develop a personalised treatment plan that takes into account the patient's genetic profile.

It is important to mention that most analyses of human biomolecular data are complemented by using the clinical data related to them.

- **Data sharing platforms:** Online platforms like Figshare, Zenodo, and Dryad provide researchers with the means to deposit and share their human biomolecular data, ensuring its long-term accessibility and enabling collaboration.

## Search and discoverability

**Search and discoverability** are crucial for finding and accessing relevant information, resources, and data related to a specific topic or area of interest, particularly in the context of infectious diseases. Infectious diseases can evolve rapidly and have significant impacts on public health, making it necessary to monitor and respond to outbreaks effectively. This requires access to up-to-date information on disease prevalence, transmission patterns, and clinical outcomes, which can come from various sources, such as clinical data, biomolecular data, public health reports, and social media.

**Standardised terminology and data formats** are also essential for effective search and discoverability in infectious disease surveillance. The use of common disease codes and data structures can facilitate the integration and analysis of data from multiple sources, making it easier to identify trends and patterns. This can improve the ability to identify emerging disease threats and develop effective disease control measures. See [Data harmonisation](#data-harmonisation) section.

**Biomolecular data sources** can be facilitated through the use of standardised data formats and data sharing platforms, allowing the  development of effective diagnostic and treatment strategies of infectious diseases data. 

Overall, search and discoverability are essential for effective infectious disease surveillance and response. By ensuring that relevant data sources are easily accessible and usable, public health professionals can more effectively monitor and control the spread of infectious diseases, ultimately protecting public health.

### Considerations

Despite the growing amount of infectious disease data stored in various sources, finding and analyzing this data can be challenging for the scientific community. There is a clear need for a user-friendly and efficient way to discover and analyse this data.

- **Data sharing platforms**: Access to data sharing platforms can facilitate the discovery and sharing of biomolecular data related to infectious diseases. Such as the [Covid19 Data Portal](https://www.covid19dataportal.org/).
- **Data privacy and security**: Privacy and security protocols must be in place to protect sensitive biomolecular data from unauthorised access.
- **Data quality**: High-quality biomolecular data is critical for accurate disease surveillance, diagnosis, and analysis. Efforts should be made to ensure that data quality is maintained throughout the data lifecycle. See [Human biomolecular data - Quality control](https://www.infectious-diseases-toolkit.org/human-biomolecular-data/quality-control) page.
- **Data storage and management**: Proper data storage and management practices must be followed to ensure that biomolecular data is organised and easily accessible to relevant parties.
- **Metadata**: Metadata should be included with biomolecular data to provide context and facilitate search and discoverability.

- **Data standardization**: Standardised data formats and common disease codes are essential for integrating and analyzing biomolecular data from different sources.

### Existing approaches

Consequently, we have compiled some of the main tools, portals, and data sharing platforms that allow for searching and discovering biomolecular data related to infectious diseases from various sources with the next considerations.

- Beacon v2: Beacon is an API (usually extended with a user interface) that allows for data discovery of phenoclinic and biomolecular data. The version 2 (v2) of the Beacon protocol has been accepted as GA4GH standard in Spring 2022. It includes, among other changes:
  - Query options for biological or technical metadata using filters defined through CURIEs (e.g. phenotypes, disease codes, sex or age).
  - An option to trigger the next step in the data access process (e.g. who to contact or which are the data use conditions).
  - An option to jump to another system where the data could be accessed (e.g. if the Beacon is for internal use of the hospital, to provide the Id of the EHR of the patients having the mutation of interest).
  - Annotations about the variants found, among which the expert/clinician conclusion about the pathogenicity of a given mutation in a given individual or its role in producing a given phenotype.
  - Information about cohorts.

## Data access and transfer

Sharing genetic and molecular information between researchers and institutions is essential for gaining a better understanding of human biology and disease. This is especially important when it comes to infectious diseases. By studying the genetic makeup of pathogens and how they interact with human cells, researchers can identify new targets for treatments and vaccines. They can also develop strategies to prevent or contain potential outbreaks before they occur.

Of course, sharing this kind of sensitive information comes with challenges. Privacy, security, and ethical considerations must be taken into account. Researchers need to handle this information responsibly and with respect for individuals' rights. Legal and regulatory barriers can also impede data sharing and collaboration.

However, the benefits of sharing human biomolecular data outweigh the risks. Access to this data is crucial for scientific progress and medical advancements. It's important for us to continue finding ways to responsibly and securely share this valuable resource. Let's work together to make sure that we do so while respecting everyone's rights and ensuring that data is kept safe and secure.

## Data harmonisation

To ensure that researchers can effectively utilise data, it is essential that it be collected and stored in a standardised manner. Using standardised formats and databases facilitates data sharing across research groups, enabling more efficient and effective analysis. This approach not only saves time, but also yields more accurate results.

Thanks to the Sars-CoV-2 outbreak, the scientific community has established standards, schemes, and data models with controlled vocabularies and ontologies explained in detail in the Human Clinical and Health Data section. One example could be the [Developing a standardized but extendable framework to increase the findability of infectious disease datasets](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9950378/) paper from February of 2023.

### Considerations

- Looking for an existing standardised metadata schema for human biomolecular data, like [MIABIS](https://github.com/BBMRI-ERIC/miabis) or [EGA](https://ega-archive.org/submission/sequence/programmatic_submissions) schemas. 
- Incorporating key data elements such as patient demographics, clinical features, and laboratory test results in the metadata schema
- Ensuring interoperability with other existing metadata schemas to facilitate data sharing and integration
- Including metadata fields for sample collection, processing, and storage information to ensure data quality and reproducibility
- Implementing controlled vocabularies and ontologies for standardised annotation and data integration
- Enabling data harmonisation across different studies to facilitate meta-analyses and systematic reviews
- Seek input and feedback from stakeholders across the research and public health communities to ensure that the schema meets the needs of diverse users and supports a range of research questions and applications.
- Regularly updating and refining the metadata schema to accommodate new data types and emerging research needs.

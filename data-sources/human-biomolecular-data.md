## Introduction

This document aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in the data sources platforms of infectious diseases using human biomolecular data, which have become increasingly important in recent years as a result of advancements in technology and the ever-growing threat of global pandemics. 

By providing this overview of the data sources platforms of infectious diseases using human biomolecular data, this document aims give the user information on where to find these types of data and how to access them (secondary use of the data) and to facilitate the development of new research initiatives and collaborations in the field.


### What is human biomolecular data, and why is it important for infectious diseases research?

Human biomolecular data refers to information obtained from the analysis of biological molecules, such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites. This type of data is used to study the molecular mechanisms underlying disease and to identify potential drug targets.

Human clinical data, on the other hand, refers to information obtained from the study of patients, including their medical histories, physical exams, and laboratory tests. This type of data is used to diagnose and treat disease, as well as to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new therapies.

While both types of data are important for understanding human health and disease, they are collected and analysed in different ways and for different purposes. 

Human biomolecular data is of great importance in infectious disease research because it plays a critical role in understanding the molecular basis of the disease. By analyzing the biomolecular data, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the disease's pathogenesis, evolution, and transmission. Personalised medicine is another area where biomolecular data can be applied. By analyzing an individual's biomolecular data, researchers can develop personalised treatment plans that are tailored to the specific needs of the patient. For example, if a patient has a genetic mutation that predisposes them to a particular disease, this information can be used to develop a personalised treatment plan that takes into account the patient's genetic profile.

Furthermore, its significance extends far beyond disease diagnosis and treatment, encompassing a broader scope of applications. For instance, a secondary use of human biomolecular data becomes vital at the population level, facilitating important policy responses during future infectious disease outbreaks. Additionally, investigating the cost-effectiveness of interventions based on these datasets enables optimal resource allocation for the most impactful healthcare strategies. By analyzing this data, we can make well-informed decisions to protect public health in a long term. 

It is important to mention that most analyses of human biomolecular data are complemented by using the clinical data related to them.

### Existing approaches

Consequently, we have compiled some of the main tools, portals, and data sharing platforms that allow for searching and discovering biomolecular data related to infectious diseases from various sources with the next considerations.

- Beacon: {% tool "beacon" %} is an API (usually extended with a user interface) that allows for data discovery of phenoclinic and biomolecular data. The version 2 (v2) of the Beacon protocol has been accepted as GA4GH standard in Spring 2022. It includes, among other changes:
  - Query options for biological or technical metadata using filters defined through CURIEs (e.g. phenotypes, disease codes, sex or age).
  - An option to trigger the next step in the data access process (e.g. who to contact or which are the data use conditions).
  - An option to jump to another system where the data could be accessed (e.g. if the Beacon is for internal use of the hospital, to provide the Id of the EHR of the patients having the mutation of interest).
  - Annotations about the variants found, among which the expert/clinician conclusion about the pathogenicity of a given mutation in a given individual or its role in producing a given phenotype.
  - Information about cohorts.

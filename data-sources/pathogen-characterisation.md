<!--- In the context of BY-COVID, a data source can a repository which should include at least the metadata and ideally the data, that might not be directly available when considering sensitive data. Also, repositories should have the capacity to share this data and therefore have a governance model in place on how to do it. It can also include registries of data sources important for the field, with a direct link to the original data sources to be able to request access to the data. --->

## Introduction

## What is pathogen characterisation data, and why is it important for infectious diseases research?

## Topic 1 

<!--- Subsection related to a specific topic related to the data sources of the category that you selected.--->

Short explanation of what this topic is about and why it is important, with an emphasis on infectious diseases and the category that you selected.

### Considerations

Using a bullet point style list format as much as possible, describe the considerations for your topic that are specific to infectious diseases within the category (e.g. pathogen characterisation) that you have selected.

Please avoid replicating 'generic' guidelines, i.e. those not specific to infectious diseases, here. Add links to RDMkit in the metadata above, if any are needed. 

### Existing approaches

Mention existing approaches related to the topic.

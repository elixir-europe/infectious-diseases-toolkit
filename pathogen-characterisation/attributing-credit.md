## Introduction 
Short introduction to the overall subject of the page. For example, it should define what is considered data analysis in pathogen characterisation in the context of IDTk.

## Concrete topic 1

Short explanation of what this topic is about and why it is important, with an emphasis on infectious diseases and the category that you selected e.g. pathogen characterisation.

### Considerations

Using a bullet point style list format as much as possible, describe the considerations for your topic that are specific to infectious diseases within the category (e.g. pathogen characterisation) that you have selected. For example, what are important features to consider when looking for data sources; what capabilities are important when defining tools to be used for quality control; what are general characteristics that one should look for in data standards for human biomolecular data. The considerations should help justify the existing approaches/solutions described in the next section. 

Please avoid replicating 'generic' guidelines, i.e. those not specific to infectious diseases, here. Add links to RDMkit in the metadata above, if any are needed. 

### Existing approaches

Using bullet point list style as much as possible, describe when, why and for what purpose a specific tool or resource should be used.

Please avoid replicating 'generic' guidelines, i.e. those not specific to infectious diseases, here.

Avoid making long lists of links to tools and resources.

The tools or resources inserted in this section do not have to be considered a 'final' or 'perfect' solution, but should be something that is used by the wider community working in this area or topic. 

Make sure to add to the the tools and resources mentioned in the text in the main Tools and resources list table all of the tools and resources mentioned in the text.

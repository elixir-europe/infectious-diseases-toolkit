# Infectious Diseases Toolkit (IDTk)

The Infectious Diseases Toolkit (IDTk) is a community effort to detail best practices related to infectious disease data management, and showcase solutions that were developed to deal with outbreaks. It was created as part of the [BeYond COVID (BY-COVID) project]( https://by-covid.org/). More information can be found in the [about](https://www.infectious-diseases-toolkit.org/about/) page.

 The content of the material is developed in Markdown and a templating system ([Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)) is used to format the Markdown pages and generate a website at ([https://www.infectious-diseases-toolkit.org](https://www.infectious-diseases-toolkit.org)). However, there are multiple [ways to contribute](https://elixir-belgium.github.io/infectious-diseases-toolkit-sandbox/contribute/#ways-of-contributing), and it is not a requirement that you are able to use these systems in order to contribute!

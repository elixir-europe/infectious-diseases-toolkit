## Funders

The Infectious Diseases Toolkit  is developed in [BY-COVID](https://by-covid.org/) that received funding from the European Union’s Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Programme under grant agreement number 101046203. Views and opinions expressed are however those of the author(s) only and do not necessarily reflect those of the European Union or the European Research Executive Agency (REA). Neither the European Union nor the granting authority can be held responsible for them.

The Infectious Diseases Toolkit is built based on the experience and ways of working of the [RDMkit](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/) and also makes use of the [ELIXIR Toolkit Theme](https://elixir-belgium.github.io/elixir-toolkit-theme/) for deployment.

Additionally we thank the funders that supported some of our contributors.

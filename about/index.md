## What is the Infectious Diseases Toolkit?
The Infectious Diseases Toolkit (IDTk) provides best practices and solutions to data challenges that affect the response to infectious diseases outbreaks. It is a community effort, which was created as part of the [BY-COVID]( https://by-covid.org/) project.

## What are the aims of IDTk?
The IDTk provides a platform for knowledge exchange to enable data mobilisation, connection and exposure, and use and analysis.

By providing a compilation of past and present efforts, collecting country specific strategies and distilling contextualised best practices from previous responses, IDTk aims to enhance infectious diseases outbreak preparedness.

## What does the IDTk offer?
 * General guidelines for data handling, analysis and visualisations in the context of infectious diseases. Where needed, additional guidelines are given for different categories of data.
 * Tools, standards and overall resources that are contextually presented, including considerations for their need and use. 
 * A collection of showcases. These are examples that combine and apply multiple resources (e.g. standards, tools, workflows) in the response to one or more infectious diseases.
 * National resources pages in which country specific experiences, examples and resources are shared.
 * The IDTk strives to connect users with the appropriate resources. A collection of tools, resources and training is offered, in addition to signposting external resources.

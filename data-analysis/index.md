Data analysis involves employing workflows tailored to different types of data, such as epidemiological, clinical, or molecular data. These workflows can include steps like data collection, cleaning, integration, and analysis, and use statistical and computational methods to uncover trends, associations, and patterns. Systematic data analysis helps researchers and health professionals to understand disease dynamics, assess intervention strategies, and improve disease prevention and control measures based on robust, data-driven insights.

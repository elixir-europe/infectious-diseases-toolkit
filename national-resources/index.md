The national resources pages below provide a general overview of resources, tools, and data related to the management of infectious disease data in a given country. Many of the resources on the pages were developed during the COVID-19 pandemic and, as such, are focused on COVID-19. However, the practices, guidance, and other resources shown can be repurposed for use with other pathogens.

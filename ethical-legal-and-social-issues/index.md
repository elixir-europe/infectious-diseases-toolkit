<!-- Please take in mind our style guide https://www.infectious-diseases-toolkit.org/contribute/style-guide when writing the content of this page. -->

## Introduction 

Provide first a short introduction to the subject covered on this page (up to 3 sentences). This could be, for example, data analysis methods relevant to pathogen characterisation. This would be the key sentences for the readers to capture the main idea of the page.

If needed be, add a further introduction to the topic that is general. Concrete topic introductions should go below.


## Concrete topic 1 <!---REPLACE THIS with the name of the topic. Example: Metadata harmonisation--->

Short explanation of what this topic is about and why it is important, with an emphasis on infectious diseases and the category that you selected e.g. pathogen characterisation.

### Considerations <!---This should not be replaced as these are considerations about concrete topic 1--->

Using a bullet point style list format as much as possible, describe what should be taken into account (i.e. what considerations you should have) for the topic being covered on this page, specifically with regard to infectious diseases in the broader category selected (e.g. pathogen characterisation). This could be, for example; which features are important to consider when selecting data sources?  What capabilities are important when defining tools to be used for quality control? What are general characteristics that you should look for in data standards for human biomolecular data. The considerations provided here should help to justify the existing approaches/solutions described in the next section. 

Please avoid replicating 'generic' guidelines, i.e. those not specific to infectious diseases, here. Add links to RDMkit in the metadata above, if any are needed. Links to other sources can also be provided in text as needed.

### Existing approaches <!---This should not be replaced as these are existing approaches for concrete topic 1--->

Using a bullet point list style as much as possible, describe when, why and for what purpose a specific tool or resource should be used.

Please avoid replicating 'generic' guidelines, i.e. those not specific to infectious diseases.

Avoid making long lists of links to tools and resources. The IDTk does not aim to list all possible approaches and solutions. The focus is on contextualised best practices approaches.

The tools or resources inserted in this section do not have to be considered a 'final' or 'perfect' solution, but should be something that is used by the wider community working in this area or topic. The existing approaches should also reflect the considerations mentioned in the “Considerations” subheading.

Make sure to add to the Tools and resources list table all of the tools and resources mentioned in the text

## Concrete topic 2 <!---REPLACE THIS with the name of the topic. Example: Metadata harmonisation--->

Follow the same guidelines as in Concrete topic 1

### Considerations <!---This should not be replaced as these are considerations about concrete topic 1--->

Follow the same guidelines as in Concrete topic 1

### Existing approaches <!---This should not be replaced as these are existing approaches for concrete topic 1--->

Follow the same guidelines as in Concrete topic 1

<!---add as many topics as need, following the same structure of topic title, Considerations, Existing approaches--->

## Introduction

## What is considered as <!--REPLACE THIS with the category that you selected e.g. pathogen characterization--> data?

## Topic 1 <!-- Subsection related to a specific topic related to the data sources of the category that you selected.-->

Short explanation of what this topic is about and why it is important, with an emphasis on infectious diseases and the category that you selected.

### Considerations

Using a bullet point style list format as much as possible, describe the considerations for your topic that are specific to infectious diseases within the category (e.g. pathogen characterisation) that you have selected.

Please avoid replicating 'generic' guidelines, i.e. those not specific to infectious diseases, here. Add links to RDMkit in the metadata above, if any are needed. 

### Standards, schemas, ontologies and vocabularies <!--- (optional) --->
